Apa yang membuat ForgetMeNot sangat efisien untuk menghafal:

    - Nol iklan. You can handle a lot of cards in a short time due to the simplicity and convenience of the user interface. Tak ada yang menghalangi Anda untuk belajar.
    - The exercise is designed so that you must eventually grasp the answer. If your answer is wrong, the card is postponed to the end of the list until you answer correct.
    - Intervals (Spaced repetition). Spaced repetition reduces the forgetting that occurs when material is not encountered for a significant time period. It also involves actively recalling learned material, which supports learning.
    - Possibility to edit a card just in the exercise. This allows you not only to correct mistakes, but also to rebuild cards if they are difficult to remember. For example, you can add an additional association in parentheses.
    - Voice accompaniment. This is especially helpful when learning languages because it improves listening skills, helps to focus on studying and favors memorization. You can even set up a deck to perceive a question exceptionally by ear.
    - Modes that allow you to practice not only in your free time. 'Walking mode' enables you do the exercise during walking. 'Autoplaying mode' lets you listen to questions and answers when your hands and eyes are busy, but your ears are free : )
    - Focusing aids. 'Motivational timer' reminds you when you've lost your attention. Full screen mode hides the status bar, which might be an additional source of distraction.
